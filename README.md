# Spring Core Certification Notes
[In Spring Core Certification Notes 4.2.md](https://github.com/tbuttler/spring-core-cert-notes-4.2/blob/master/Spring%20Core%20Certification%20Notes%204.2.md), there are notes, which I used as a part of my preparation for the certification. These notes (and the flashcards below) were originally created by vojtechruz. I have extended them with a few things I was interested in. Feel free to edit any inaccuracies, typos or mistakes and create a pull request for that.
